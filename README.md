# Assumptions

- correctAnswers and wrongAnswers given are the same length

# Constraints

- Would have liked to implement the 3 options but felt I'd spent enough time on this.
- Isn't aware of text size, etc. So doesn't automatically resize.
- The Switch component is fairly coupled to the css, as it assumes 125 and 200 for the toggle directions.
- Background colour is hard-coded, although this can easily be pulled out into props.
